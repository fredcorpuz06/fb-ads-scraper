# Facebook Ad Scraper
Downloads all the image and video content from Facebook ads queried on the Facebook API (focusing on political ads). 

The [Wesleyan Media Project](http://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/) tracks and analyzes all broadcast ads aired by federal and state election candidates in every media market in the country. The collected data will be leveraged by researchers to "enhance the ability of scholars, citizens, and journalists to hold government accountable by providing public information on how special interests are attempting to influence American democracy."
